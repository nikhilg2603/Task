the customs authorities have the first right to sell the imported
goods under the Customs Act, 19625 and adjust the sale proceeds
towards payment of customs duty. 
2.
The Company, during the period 1994-2000, was granted and
availed of financial assistance from the appellant – IDBI. As a
security, the Company had hypothecated movable properties and
created equitable mortgage of immovable properties by depositing
title deeds. The charge was duly registered with the Registrar of
Companies.  In  addition,  the  promoters  and  guarantors  had
furnished personal guarantees.
3.
In the present case, we are concerned with the hypothecated
movable  property,  namely,  machinery  and  its  components,
imported  from  Italy  during  the  years  1998-1999.  The  goods,
packed in 128 wooden containers, were warehoused in a private
bonded warehouse by executing bond in terms of Section 59(1) of
the Customs Act. The goods were initially warehoused for one
year, which period was extended. However, as the goods were not
cleared  for  home  consumption  in  terms  of  Section  47  of  the
Customs  Act,  even  after  expiry  of  the  extended  period  of
warehousing,  show-cause  notices  were  issued6,  and  after
considering  the  explanation  given  by  the  Company,  orders-in-

original dated 15th September 20007 and 10th October 20008 were
passed confirming levy of customs duty of Rs.3,27,22,191/- and
Rs.10,48,29,017/-, respectively. When the Company did not pay
the  duty,  the  authorities  had  passed  an  order9 dated  19th
December 2000 for sale of the warehoused goods for recovery of
the customs duty, relying on the powers conferred under Section
72(2)  read  with  Section  142  of  the  Customs  Act.  Thereafter,
another  order10 under  Section  72(2)  of  the  Customs  Act  was
passed  on  27th February  2002  for  detention  and  sale  of  the
warehoused goods for recovery of Rs.22,20,38,112/-. On failure to
pay  the  duty,  steps were initiated for  auctioning the imported
goods and the Company was informed.
4.
In the meanwhile, Company Petition No. 168 of 2002 was filed
before the Andhra Pradesh  High Court  for  winding  up  of  the
Company.  This  petition  was  admitted  on  1st April  2003.  The
Company was directed to be wound up vide the order passed on
1st December 2003. Thereupon, the Official Liquidator filed an
application11 under Section 468 of the Companies Act read with
Rules 9 and 11(b) of the Companies (Court) Rules, 195912 for
directing the customs authorities to handover possession of the
7 Order in Original No. 1/2000 (Customs).

imported goods, which had been put up for auction for payment of
the customs duty. This application was allowed by a single judge
of  the  High  Court  vide the  order  dated  3rd September  2004
observing, inter alia, that the customs authorities had not followed
the  procedure  contemplated  under  the  Customs  Act  before
passing the order under Section 72 of the Customs Act, in the
absence of which the detention orders were void  ab initio and
non-est in the eyes of law. Secondly, on an order of winding up
being passed, in terms of Section 456 of the Companies Act, the
assets of the company in liquidation, by operation of law, vest in
the Official Liquidator, who alone was entitled to deal with the
effects  and  actionable  claims.  Reference  was  also  made  to
Section 447 of the Companies Act13. Consequently, as the winding
up order had been passed against the Company but sale was yet
to be effected, the Official Liquidator was duty bound to take into
his  custody  and  control  all  properties,  effects  and  actionable
claims,  including  the  movable  property,  that  is,  the  imported
goods. Official Liquidator, as the custodian of all the properties of
the  Company,  functions  under  the  directions  of  the  Company
Court. Any person making any claim against the Company has to
prove his claim before the Official Liquidator by placing necessary

are of relevance.

material in support. Accordingly,  the submission regarding the
custom authorities’ entitlement and right under the Customs Act to
sell the imported goods to realise their dues was rejected.
5.
On the customs authorities preferring an intra-court appeal, the
mater was referred to the full bench of the Andhra Pradesh High
Court on the question of whether the claim of a secured creditor
has  precedence  over  the  right  of  the  customs  authorities  to
recover the customs duty. The full bench, relying on and approving
the ratio of the Calcutta High Court in Collector of Customs v.
Dytron (India) Ltd.14, disagreed with the view expressed by a full
bench of the Madras High Court in  UTI Bank Ltd. v.  Deputy
Commissioner of Central Excise and Another15. The full bench
of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has held that Section 46816 of
the  Companies  Act  has  no  application  as  it  empowers  the
Company  Court  to  require  the  ‘contributory’  to  pay,  deliver,
surrender or transfer any money, property or books and papers in
his custody or control. The word ‘contributory’, defined in Section
428  of  the  Companies  Act,  does  not  include  the  customs
department/authorities.  Observations  relying  on  the  ratio  in

would advert to later.

Aggrieved, the appellant – IBDI, as a secured creditor, has filed
the present appeal. While issuing notice in the appeal vide order
dated  3rd May  2010,  it  was directed that  status  quo  shall  be
maintained. Thereafter,  vide order dated 5th October 2017, the
customs  authorities,  along  with  the  appellant  –  IDBI  and  the
Official Liquidator, were permitted to sell the goods subject to
deposit of the auction sale proceeds with the Registry of this
Court.  The  sale  proceeds  vide two  demand  drafts  of  Rs.
1,39,34,208/-  and Rs.  33,343/-  dated 20th January 2023 have
been deposited in this Court and converted into a fixed deposit
receipt. The auction proceeds are to be paid as per the outcome
of the present appeal.
7.
In the context of the present appeal, we would like to reproduce
Sections 529A and 530 of the Companies Act, which read as
under:
“529A.  Overriding  preferential  payments.—(1)
Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any  other
provision of this Act or any other law for the time being
in force, in the winding up of a company,—
(a) workmen's dues; and
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 6 of 38
(b) debts due to secured creditors to the extent such
debts rank under clause (c) of the proviso to sub-
section (1) of Section 529 pari passu with such dues,
shall be paid in priority to all other debts.
(2) The debts payable under clause (a) and clause (b)
of  sub-section  (1)  shall  be  paid  in  full,  unless  the
assets are insufficient to meet them, in which case
they shall abate in equal proportions.”
“530. Preferential payments.—(1) In a winding up,
subject to the provisions of Section 529-A, there shall
be paid in priority to all other debts—
(a) all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due from the
company to the Central or a State Government or to a
local authority at the relevant date as defined in clause
(c) of sub-section (8) and having become due and
payable  within  the  twelve  months  next  before  that
date;
(b) all wages or salary (including wages payable for
time or piece work and salary earned wholly or in part
by way of commission) of any employee, in respect of
services  rendered  to  the  company  and  due  for  a
period not exceeding four months within the twelve
months next before the relevant date, subject to the
limit specified in sub-section (2);
(c)  all  accrued  holiday  remuneration  becoming
payable to any employee, or in the case of his death to
any other person in his right, on the termination of his
employment before or by the effect of, the winding up
order or resolution;
(d) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily
merely  for  the  purposes  of  reconstruction  or  of
amalgamation with another company, all amounts due,
in respect of contributions payable during the twelve
months next before the relevant date, by the company
as the employer of any persons, under the Employees'
State Insurance Act, 1948, (34 of 1948), or any other
law for the time being in force;
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 7 of 38
(e) unless the company is being wound up voluntarily
merely  for  the  purposes  of  reconstruction  or  of
amalgamation with another company, or unless the
company has, at the commencement of the winding
up,  under  such  a  contract  with  insurers  as  is
mentioned  in  Section  14  of  the  Workmen's
Compensation  Act,  1923,  rights  capable  of  being
transferred to and vested in the workman, all amounts
due  in  respect  of  any  compensation  or  liability  for
compensation  under the  said  Act in  respect  of  the
death  or  disablement  of  any  employee  of  the
company;
(f) all sums due to any employee from a provident
fund, a pension fund, a gratuity fund or any other fund
for the welfare of the employees, maintained by the
company; and
(g)  the  expenses  of  any  investigation  held  in
pursuance of Section 235 or 237, in so far as they are
payable by the company.
(2) The sum to which priority is to be given under
clause (b) of sub-section (1), shall not, in the case of
any  one  claimant,  exceed  such  sum  as  may  be
notified  by  the  Central  Government  in  the  Official
Gazette:
(3) Where any compensation under the Workmen's
Compensation  Act,  1923  (8  of  1923),  is  a  weekly
payment, the amount due in respect thereof shall, for
the purposes of clause (e) of sub-section (1), be taken
to be the amount of the lump sum for which the weekly
payment  could  if  redeemable,  be  redeemed  if  the
employer made an application for that purpose under
the said Act.
(4)  Where  any  payment  has  been  made  to  any
employee of a company,—
(i) on account of wages or salary; or
(ii) to him, or in the case of his death, to any other
person  in  his  right  on  account  of  accrued  holiday
remuneration,
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 8 of 38
out  of  money  advance  by  some  person  for  that
purpose,  the  person  by  whom  the  money  was
advanced shall, in a winding up, have a right of priority
in respect of the money so advanced and paid, up to
the amount by which the sum in respect of which the
employee  or  other  person  in  his  right,  would  have
been entitled to priority in the winding up has been
diminished  by  reason  of  the  payment  having  been
made.
(5) The foregoing debts shall—
(a) rank equally among themselves and be paid in full,
unless  the  assets  are  insufficient  to  meet  them,  in
which case they shall abate in equal proportions; and
(b) so far as the assets of the company available for
payment of general creditors are insufficient to meet
them,  have  priority  over  the  claims  of  holders  of
debentures under any floating charge created by the
company, and be paid accordingly out of any property
comprised in or subject to that charge.
(6) Subject to the retention of such sums as may be
necessary for the costs and expenses of the winding
up, the foregoing debts shall be discharged forthwith
so far as the assets are sufficient to meet them, and in
the case of the debts to which priority is given by
clause (d) of sub-section (1), formal proof thereof shall
not be required except in so far as may be otherwise
prescribed.
(7)  In  the  event  of  a  landlord  or  other  person
distraining or having distrained on any goods or effects
of the company within three months next before the
date of a winding up order, the debts to which priority
is given by this section shall be a first charge on the
goods or effects so distrained on, or the proceeds of
the sale thereof:
Provided that, in respect of any money paid under any
such charge, the landlord or other person shall have
the same rights of priority as the person to whom the
payment is made.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 9 of 38
(8) For the purposes of this section—
(a) any remuneration in respect of a period of holiday
or of absence from work through sickness or other
good cause shall be deemed to be wages in respect of
services rendered to the company during that period;
(b)  the  expression  “accrued  holiday  remuneration”
includes, in relation to any person, all sums which by
virtue either of his contract of employment or of any
enactment  (including  any  order  made  or  direction
given under any enactment), are payable on account
of  the  remuneration  which  would,  in  the  ordinary
course, have become payable to him in respect of a
period  of  holiday,  had  his  employment  with  the
company  continued  until  he  became  entitled  to  be
allowed the holiday;
(bb)  the expression “employee” does not include a
workman; and
(c) the expression “the relevant date” means—
(i) in the case of a company ordered to be wound up
compulsorily,  the  date  of  the  appointment  (or  first
appointment) of a provisional liquidator, or if no such
appointment was made, the date of the winding up
order,  unless  in  either  case  the  company  had
commenced to be wound up voluntarily before that
date; and
(ii) in any case where sub-clause (i) does not apply,
the  date  of  the  passing  of  the  resolution  for  the
voluntary winding up of the company.
(9) This section shall not apply in the case of a winding
up where the date referred to in sub-section (5) of
Section 230 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of
1913), occurred before the commencement of this Act,
and  in  such  a  case,  the  provisions  relating  to
preferential payments which would have applied if this
Act had not been passed, shall be deemed to remain
in full force.”

Section 529A of the Companies Act, a non-obstante provision, is
to be given primacy in case of conflict, and consequently, in case
of disharmony, this section will override the discordant provisions
of the Companies Act and all other enactments in force. Section
529A of the Companies Act was enforced by Act No. 35 of 1985
with effect from 24th May 1985. Therefore, when there is a clash
and disagreement between section 529A of the Companies Act
and  another  provision  of  the  Companies  Act  or  any  other
enactment in force on 24th May 1985, Section 529A prevails and
the  debts  are  to  be  paid  in  terms  of  Section  529A  of  the
Companies Act.
9.
As  per  clause  (b)  of  sub-Section  (1)  to  Section  529A of  the
Companies Act, the debts due to secured creditors to the extent
such debts under clause (c) of the proviso to sub-Section (1) to
Section 52917 rank pari passu with the workmen’s dues18, are to be
paid in priority to all other debts. Sub-section (2) to Section 529A
states that the debts payable under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-
Section (1) to Section 529A shall be paid in full, unless the assets
are insufficient to meet them, in which case they shall abate in
equal proportions. 
17 Clause (c) to the proviso to Section 529 has been quoted subsequently.
18 The expression ‘Workmen’s dues’ in Sections 529, 529A and 530 of the Companies Act is defined
and restricted under sub-section (3)(b) to Section 529 of the Companies Act.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 11 of 38
10.
In the present case, we are not required to examine the inter-play
and principle of proportionality with reference to clauses (a) and
(b) to Section 529A of the Companies Act, albeit we must give full
effect to and enforce the non-obstante nature of Section 529A of
the Companies Act, whereby, notwithstanding anything contained
in any other provision of the Companies Act or any other law for
the time being in force on 24th May 1985, on winding up of a
company,  the debt  due to the workmen and the debt  due to
secured creditors as specified, rank pari passu and are to be paid
in the manner prescribed therein in priority to all other debts. 
11.
Section 530 of  the Companies  Act,  which  was amended and
substituted by Act No. 35 of 1985 with effect from 24th May 1985,
states that Section 530 is subject to provisions of Section 529A of
the Companies Act. Section 530 of the Companies Act deals with
preferential  payments  that  are  a  level  below  the  overriding
preferential payments under Section 529A of the Companies Act.
Clause  (a)  to  Section  530(1)  of  the  Companies  Act  confers
preferential status to all revenue taxes, cesses, and rates ‘due’ to
the Central or the State government or to a local authority on the
‘relevant  date’ as  defined  in  clause  (c)  to  sub-section  (8)  to
Section 530 of the Companies Act, which have become ‘due and
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 12 of 38
payable’ within the twelve months next before the relevant date.
The  taxes,  cesses  and  rates  due  to  the  Central  and  State
governments  or  local  authorities  under  Section  530  of  the
Companies Act cannot be given priority over the payments/debts
mentioned in Section 529A of the Companies Act. It is, therefore,
beyond  debate  that  the  provisions  of  Section  529A  of  the
Companies Act prevail over Section 530 of the Companies Act. 
12.
We shall subsequently interpret the expression debts ‘due’ in the
first portion of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act
and the words ‘become due and payable within the twelve months
next before that date’ in the latter portion of clause (a) to Section
530(1) of the Companies Act, but at this stage, it is relevant to
take on record the ‘relevant date’ as defined in clause (c) to sub-
Section (8) to Section 530 of the Companies Act. As per sub-
clause (i) to clause (c) to sub-Section (8) to Section 530 of the
Companies Act, the ‘relevant date’ in case where a company has
been ordered to be wound up compulsorily, shall be the date of
appointment or first appointment of a provisional liquidator, or if no
such appointment is made, the date of the winding up order,
unless the company had commenced to be wound up voluntarily
before that date. The present case is one of compulsory winding
up  and,  therefore,  the  ‘relevant  date’,  in  the  absence  of
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 13 of 38
appointment  of  a provisional liquidator,  would be the date  on
which the winding up order was passed against the Company,
which is 1st December 200319.
13.
Again, before we proceed to interpret the expressions debt ‘due’
and debt ‘due and payable’ in clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the
Companies Act, it is relevant to take note of the effect of Sections
447, 456, 468, 528 and 529 of the Companies Act, as well as the
object and purpose behind these provisions. The relevant sections
read as follows:
“447.  Effect  of  winding  up  order.—  An  order  for
winding up a company shall operate in favour of all the
creditors and of all the contributories of the company
as if it had been made on all the joint petition of a
creditor and of a contributory.”
“456. Custody of company's property—(1) Where a
winding  up  order  has  been  made  or  where  a
provisional liquidator has been appointed the liquidator
or the provisional liquidator, as the case may be, shall
take  into  his  custody  or  under  his  control,  all  the
property, effects and actionable claims to which the
company is or appears to be entitled.
(1-A) For the purpose of enabling the liquidator or the
provisional liquidator, as the case may be, to take into
his custody or under his control, any property, effects
or  actionable  claims  to  which  the  company  is  or
appears to be entitled, the liquidator or the provisional
liquidator, as the case may be, may by writing request
the  Chief  Presidency  Magistrate  or  the  District
Magistrate  within  whose  jurisdiction  such  property,
effects or actionable claims or any books of account or
other documents of the company may be found, to

Company Petition No. 168 of 2002.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 14 of 38
take  possession  thereof,  and  the  Chief  Presidency
Magistrate or the District Magistrate may thereupon
after such notice as he may think fit to give to any
party,  take  possession  of  such  property,  effects,
actionable  claims  books  of  account  or  other
documents  and  deliver  possession  thereof  to  the
liquidator or the provisional liquidator.
(1-B) For the purpose of securing compliance with the
provisions of sub-section (1-A), the Chief Presidency
Magistrate or the District Magistrate may take or cause
to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used
such force as may in his opinion be necessary.”
“468.  Delivery  of  property  to  liquidator.—The
Tribunal may, at any time after making a winding up
order, require any contributory for the time being on
the  list  of  contributories,  and  any  trustee,  receiver,
banker,  agent,  officer  or  other  employee  of  the
company,  to  pay,  deliver,  surrender  or  transfer
forthwith, or within such time as the Tribunal directs, to
the  liquidator,  any  money,  property  or  books  and
papers in his custody or under his control to which the
company is prima facie entitled.”
“528. Debts of all descriptions to be admitted to
proof.— In every winding up (subject, in the case of
insolvent companies, to the application in accordance
with the provisions of this Act of the law of insolvency),
all  debts  payable  on  a  contingency,  and  all  claims
against  the  company,  present  or  future,  certain  or
contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages,
shall be admissible, to proof against the company, a
just estimate being made, so far as possible, of the
value of such debts or claims as may be subject to any
contingency, or may sound only in damages, or for
some other reason may not bear a certain value.”
“529. Application of insolvency rules in winding up
of insolvent companies.— (1) In the winding up of an
insolvent company, the same rules shall prevail and be
observed with regard to—
(a) debts provable;
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 15 of 38
(b) the valuation of annuities and future and contingent
liabilities; and
(c)  the  respective  rights  of secured  and  unsecured
creditors;
as are in force for the time being under the law of
insolvency  with  respect  to  the  estates  of  persons
adjudged insolvent:
Provided that the security of every secured creditor
shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge
in  favour  of  the  workmen  to  the  extent  of  the
workmen's  portion  therein,  and  where  a  secured
creditor,  instead  of  relinquishing  his  security  and
proving his debt, opts to realise his security,—
(a)  the  liquidator  shall  be  entitled  to  represent  the
workmen and enforce such charge;
(b) any amount realised by the liquidator by way of
enforcement of such charge shall be applied rateably
for the discharge of workmen's dues; and
(c) so much of the debt due to such secured creditor
as  could  not  be  realised  by  him  by  virtue  of  the
foregoing provisions of this proviso or the amount of
the  workmen's  portion  in  his  security,  whichever  is
less, shall rank pari passu with the workmen's dues for
the purposes of Section 529-A.
(2) All persons who in any such case would be entitled
to prove for and receive dividends out of the assets of
the company, may come in under the winding up, and
make  such  claims  against  the  company  as  they
respectively  are  entitled  to  make  by  virtue  of  this
section.
Provided  that  if  a  secured  creditor  instead  of
relinquishing  his  security  and  proving  for  his  debt
proceeds to realise his security, he shall be liable to
pay  his  portion  of  the  expenses  incurred  by  the
liquidator (including a provisional liquidator, if any) for
the preservation of the security before its realization by
the secured creditor.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 16 of 38
Explanation.—For  the  purposes  of  this proviso,  the
portion of expenses incurred by the liquidator for the
preservation of a security which the secured creditor
shall  be  liable  to  pay  shall  be  the  whole  of  the
expenses  less  an  amount  which  bears  to  such
expenses  the  same  proportion  as  the  workmen's
portion in relation to the security bears to the value of
the security.
(3) For the purposes of this section, Section 529-A and
Section 530,—
(a) “workmen”, in relation to a company, means the
employees of the company, being workmen within the
meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947;
(b) “workmen's dues”, in relation to a company, means
the  aggregate  of  the  following  sums  due  from  the
company to its workmen, namely:—
(i) all wages or salary including wages payable for
time or piece work and salary earned wholly or in
part by way of commission of any workman, in
respect of services rendered to the company and
any compensation payable to any workman under
any of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947;
(ii)  all  accrued  holiday  remuneration  becoming
payable to any workman, or in the case of his
death  to  any  other  person  in  his  right,  on  the
termination of his employment before, or by the
effect of, the winding up order or resolution;
(iii)  unless  the  company  is  being  wound  up
voluntarily  merely  for  the  purposes  of
reconstruction  or  of  amalgamation  with  another
company,  or  unless  the  company  has,  at  the
commencement of the winding up, under such a
contract with insurers as is mentioned in Section
14  of the Workmen's  Compensation  Act, 1923,
rights capable of being transferred to and vested
in the workman, all amounts due in respect of any
compensation or liability for compensation under
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 17 of 38
the said Act in respect of the death or disablement
of any workman of the company;
(iv) all sums due to any workman from a provident
fund, a pension fund, a gratuity fund or any other
fund for the welfare of the workmen, maintained
by the company;
(c) “workmen's portion”, in relation to the security of
any secured creditor of a company, means the amount
which bears to the value of the security the same
proportion as the amount of the workmen's dues bears
to the aggregate of—
(i) the amount of workmen's dues; and
(ii) the amounts of the debts due to the secured
creditors.”
14.
As per Section 447 of the Companies Act, an order for winding up
of a company operates in favour of all the creditors as if it had
been made on a joint petition of a creditor. All creditors are treated
as  petitioning  creditors.  Section  456  of  the  Companies  Act
requires a provisional liquidator or a liquidator, as the case may
be, to take all properties and action claims, to which the company
is or appears to be entitled, into his custody or under his control.
Sub-section (1A) to Section 456 of the Companies Act entitles the
liquidator or the provisional liquidator to write a request to the
Chief  Presidency  Magistrate  or  the  District  Magistrate  within
whose jurisdiction such property, effects or actionable claims etc.
of the company may be found, and, thereupon, these officers,
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 18 of 38
after giving notice to the party, are to take possession of the
properties, effects, actionable claims, books of accounts, etc and
deliver the possession to the liquidator or provisional liquidator.
Sub-section (1B) to Section 456 of the Companies Act permits the
Chief Presidency Magistrate or the District Magistrate to take such
steps or use such force, as in his opinion may be necessary.
Section 468 of the Companies Act permits the tribunal/court to
direct any contributory, trustee, receiver, banker, agent, officer or
other  employee  of  the  company  to  pay,  deliver,  surrender  or
transfer forthwith, or within such time as directed, to the liquidator,
any money, property, or books and papers in his custody and
control to which the company is prima facie entitled.
15.
Sections 528 to 530 of the Companies Act fall under Chapter V -
‘Provisions Applicable to Every Mode of Winding Up’, under the
sub-heading ‘proof and ranking of claims’. Section 528 of the
Companies Act states that debts of all descriptions, including the
debts payable on contingency, and claims against the company,
present or future, ascertained or sounding only in damages, shall
be admissible to proof against the company, on a just estimate
being made of such debts as far as possible. Section 456 of the
Companies Act, inter alia, provides that all the property and effects
of the Company shall be deemed to be in the custody of the
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 19 of 38
tribunal/court as from the date of the order for the winding up of
the Company.
16.
The objective of giving jurisdiction to the Company Court/tribunal
during the process of liquidation of the Company is two-fold: First,
to ensure that the assets of a company in liquidation are amassed
and constellated to prevent a scramble and dissipation of the
assets  of  an  insolvent  company.  Secondly,  the  Company
Court/tribunal is entrusted with paying off debts from the sale
proceeds of the assets so assimilated, according to the waterfall
mechanism provided for and specified under Sections 529, 529A
and  530  of  the  Companies  Act.  Accordingly,  and  with  this
objective,  Section  529A of  the  Companies  Act  refers  to  the
doctrine of pari passu in the proviso to sub-section (1) to Section
529, with reference to the claims  inter se  the workmen and the
secured  creditors.  Even  otherwise,  on  a  conspectus  of  these
sections, the principle applicable and underlying these provisions
is to stop alienation and preserve the assets on the date of the
bankruptcy, which date, in some cases, can relate back to the
date of filing of the winding up petition, as in case of execution of a
decree. This preservation is with a view to ensure the division and
application of the assets of the company being wound up, as it
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 20 of 38
stood on the relevant date.20 The payment must be made in terms
of the priority prescribed.
17.
This Court in J.K. (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. New Kaiser-I-Hind Spg.
and Wvg. Co. Ltd.21 has held that once a winding up order is
passed, the assets of the company under liquidation are passed
under  the control of  the liquidator,  whose statutory duty is to
realize  them.  Thereafter,  the  creditors  are  paid  out  by  the
liquidator from the sale proceeds of the assets of the liquidated
company. The creditors have to be paid in terms of the waterfall or
priority mechanism. Therefore, payment has to be first made in
terms  of  Section  529A  of  the  Companies  Act  to  overriding
preferential creditors,  then to preferential creditors in terms of
Section 530 of the Companies Act and lastly, payment has to be
made and distributed pari passu among the ordinary or unsecured
creditors.  This objective and intent  is also apparent  when we
examine the Company Court Rules, as per which the liquidator is
to fix a date on or before which all creditors of the company are to
prove their debts or claims and to establish any title they may
have to priority under Section 530 of the Companies Act.22 Not
only this, the rules enable a creditor to claim interest up to the
date  of  the  winding  up  order,  and  in  certain  circumstances,

payment of interest subsequent to the date of winding up.23 There
is, however, an exception to the two-fold method, as has been
held in Dena Bank v. Bhikhabhai Prabhudas Parekh & Co. and
Others24, which we will subsequently elucidate.
18.
This brings us to the interpretation of the expressions debt ‘due’
and debt ‘due and payable’ in Section 530(1)(a) of the Companies
Act.  The  interpretation  is  no  longer  debatable  in  view  of  the
judgment of this Court in  Rajratha Naranbhai Mills Co. Ltd. v.
Sales Tax Officer, Petlad25, which has approved the view taken
by D.A. Desai, J., in his judgment in Sales Tax Officer, Petlad v.
Rajratna Naranbhai Mills Co. Ltd. and Another26, a judgment,
which,  we  respectfully  submit,  forms  the  foundation  of  our
reasoning and ratio in the present case. This Court in Rajratha
Naranbhai  Mills  Co.  Ltd.  (supra),  agreeing  with  the  views
expressed by D.A. Desai, J. in Sales Tax Officer, Petlad (supra),
overruled the judgment of the division bench under challenge, for
several reasons, to hold that the words debt ‘due’ occurring in the
first part and the words debt ‘due and payable’ in the latter part of
Section 530(1)(a) of the Companies Act are different expressions
meant to convey different and not the same meaning. Therefore,

Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 22 of 38
for a government debt to be covered under clause (a) to Section
530(1) of the Companies Act, it must not only be a debt ‘due’, but
it must also be a debt ‘due and payable’ within twelve months next
before the relevant date. The requirements of the latter portion of
clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the Companies Act are dual and
cumulative, which is debt ‘due and payable’, and not one that is
‘due’. The debt ‘due’ must have become payable at any time
within twelve months next before the relevant date. The debt ‘due
and payable’ prior to twelve months next to the relevant date is not
a preferential debt in terms of Section 530(1)(a) of the Companies
Act. Such debt will rank  pari passu with ordinary or unsecured
creditors, without any preferential treatment. In this regard, we
quote the following passages from the decision of this Court in
Rajratha Naranbhai Mills Co. Ltd. (supra):
“8. We have gone through both the judgments afore-
referred to very carefully and minutely and have heard
learned counsel on the conflicting decisions. There are
wide ranging discussions in the interpretative process
relating to the word ‘due’ occurring in the earlier part of
the provision and the words ‘due and payable’ in the
later part, and whether they are different expressions
meant to convey differently or they mean the same
thing. With due respect to the High Court, we feel that
relevant  and  important  considerations  and  material
though  available,  which  could  go  to  interpret  the
section  purposively  was  overlooked,  and  at  this
juncture we wish to put it to use.

11. In A. Ramaiya's The Companies Act (11th edn.
1988) it has been noticed at page 1320 that Section
530  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956  has  been  largely
recast  and  amended  in  the  light  of  the  following
recommendations  (excerpted)  of  the  Company  Law
Committee in paragraph 218 of their Report:
xx

In  this  connection  we  should  like  to  refer  to  a
memorandum that we received from the Central Board
of Revenue, on the question of a priority to be given to
crown demands generally and, in particular, to arrears
of income tax, super tax and corporation tax. It was
suggested that there should be no time limit for the
preferential payment of these crown debts and that
Section 230 of the Indian Companies Act should be
amended accordingly. The practical difficulty of giving
effect to the suggestion is that it would place a great
majority of the unsecured creditors of the company at
the mercy of the income tax authorities, inasmuch as,
whatever may be the nature of the security on which
they may have lent money to a company at the time of
the loan, the unforeseeable demands of the income
tax authorities on the company without any time limit
would rank over the claims of such creditors. In these
circumstances,  it  may  be  extremely  difficult  for  the
company  to  raise  capital  for  its  working... We  are
aware of the large arrears of income and other taxes
which  are  due  by  many  companies,  which  are  in
liquidation,  but  we  would  venture  to  think  that  the
remedy  for  this  unsatisfactory  situation  is  not  the
conferment of preferential rights without limit to the
income tax authorities under Section 230 of the Indian
Companies  Act,  but  the  energetic  completion  of
assessment proceedings and vigorous measures for
the collection of the assessed taxes.

13. Both benches of the High Court, with due respect,
gave  to  the  provision  a  very  wide  and  varied
interpretation  and  that  too  on  literality  and
grammaticals  seemingly  overlooking  the  legal
philosophy which permeates the provision, the same
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 24 of 38
being that the debts due and payable, so as to claim
priority, must be appropriated to the period within 12
months next before the relevant date and their liability
for payment must be founded during that period and
no other. To put it in simpler words, the State has a
priority over debts, liability and obligation of which was
born within the time frame of those twelve months and
as such due and becoming due and payable within
those twelve months next before the relevant date,
ascertainable  if  necessary  later,  if  not  already
ascertained. We are in respectful agreement with the
interpretation put by the Court of Appeal to Section
264 of the English Companies Act in Airedale Garage
case,  analogous  as  it  is  to  the  provision  in  hand,
warranting the same interpretation; more so when any
other interpretation would lead to the results feared by
the  Company  Law  Committee  extracted  above.  In
such  view  of  the  matter,  we  need  not  elaborately
comment, discuss or demolish, sentence by sentence,
the reasoning given by the Single Bench as also the
Division Bench of the High Court towards interpreting
the  provision.  The  words  ‘having  become  due  and
payable  within  12  months  next  before  the  relevant
date’ need be understood to mean putting a restriction
or  cordoning  off  the  amount  for  which  priority  is
claimable and not in respect of each and every debt
on account of taxes, rates and cesses etc. which may
be outstanding at that time and payable. And further
that such priority is in respect only of debts those of
which become due and payable because the liability to
those is rooted, founded and belonging to that period
of twelve months prior to the relevant date and none
other; both the conditions existing.”
19.
D.A.  Desai,  J.,  in his  judgment  in  Sales  Tax  Officer,  Petlad
(supra)  as  a judge  of  Gujarat  High  Court,  had examined the
question  of  when  a  debt  becomes  payable,  for  this  is  a
requirement to be satisfied, and only when the debt becomes ‘due
and payable’ during the twelve months next before the relevant
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 25 of 38
date, does the debt get the character of a preferential debt. After
elaborate  discussion,  D.A.  Desai,  J.  has  held  that  the  debt
becomes ‘due’ under the applicable taxing statute on the date
when the sale, that is, the taxing event takes place. Tax may
become ‘due’ but may be payable in future in terms of the statute.
In the context of the Sales Tax Act in question27, it was held that
the sales tax became ‘due and payable’ when the returns were
filed.  Determination or  quantification of  the tax at  the time of
passing of the assessment order in terms of the Sales Tax Act,
Sales Tax Officer, Petlad (supra) holds, was not relevant. We
need not refer to the Sales Tax Act relevant in Sales Tax Officer,
Petlad (supra) for the purpose of the present case. On the other
hand, we would have to refer to the provisions of the Customs Act
to ascertain the date on which the customs duty in respect of the
goods in question became ‘due and payable’. We are answering
this question, though not necessary, as the appellant – IDBI is an
overriding  preferential  creditor  under  Section  529A  of  the
Companies Act and at best, if the requirements of clause (a) to
Section 530(1) of the Companies Act are satisfied, the customs
dues would fall under Section 530 of the Companies Act and will
be categorized as preferential payment. To decide this question,
we shall also be examining the question of whether the Customs
27 Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953 and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 26 of 38
Act creates a first charge overriding the charge in favour of the
secured creditor, namely, the appellant – IDBI.
20.
This Court in  Dena Bank (supra), while examining the issue of
priority of government dues or Crown debts over the dues of other
creditors, opined that the Crown's preferential right to recovery of
debts over other creditors is confined to ordinary or unsecured
creditors.  The  common  law  principles  of  equity  and  good
conscience,  as  applicable  in  India  and  the  common  law  of
England,  do  not  accord  the  government  or  Crown  dues  a
preferential right for recovery of dues or debts over a mortgagee,
pledgee of goods or a secured creditor. The common law doctrine
giving preferential rights to the Crown debts confined to ordinary
or unsecured creditors constitutes ‘law in force’ within the meaning
of Article 372(1) of the Constitution of India, and accordingly, this
law continues to be in force. This Court in  Dena Bank (supra)
specifically refers to and approves the statement of law made in
‘Rashbehary Ghose: Law of Mortgage’28 – “It seems a government
debt in India is not entitled to precedence over a prior secured
debt.”  This  principle  also  emanates  from  the  decision  of  the
Constitution bench of this Court in Builders Supply Corporation
v.  Union of India and Others29, which was followed by a three
28 TLL, 7th Edn., p. 386.
29 (1965) 2 SCR 289.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 27 of 38
judges’  bench  in  Collector  of  Aurangabad  and  Another v.
Central Bank of India and Another30. At the same time, we must
record for clarity that this principle, which vents from the ‘law in
force’ within the meaning of Article 372(1) of the Constitution of
India, must give way to a statutory charge which may be created
by an enactment, whereby a first charge is given to government
dues or Crown debts, notwithstanding the charge of the secured
creditors. 
21.
Having considered the provisions of the Companies Act, and the
general  principles  of  law,  we  would  now  proceed  to  examine
whether the Customs Act creates a first charge for payment of the
customs  dues,  and  if  so,  harmonise  and  resolve  the  conflict
between the Companies Act and the Customs Act.
22.
We would begin by quoting Section 15 of the Customs Act:
“15. Date for determination of rate of duty and tariff
valuation of imported goods.—(1) The rate of duty
and tariff valuation, if any, applicable to any imported
goods, shall be the rate and valuation in force,—
(a)  in  the  case  of  goods  entered  for  home
consumption under Section 46, on the date on which a
bill of entry in respect of such goods is presented
under that section;
(b) in the case of goods cleared from a warehouse
under Section 68, on the date on which a bill of entry
30 (1967) 3 SCR 855.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 28 of 38
for home consumption in respect of such goods is
presented under that section;
(c) in the case of any other goods, on the date of
payment of duty:
Provided that if a bill of entry has been presented
before the date of entry inwards of the vessel or the
arrival of the aircraft or the vehicle by which the goods
are imported, the bill of entry shall be deemed to have
been presented on the date of such entry inwards or
the arrival, as the case may be.
(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to
baggage and goods imported by post.”
In the present case, upon import of the goods, the Company
had entered the goods for home consumption under Section 46 of
the Customs Act, which reads as under:
“46.  Entry  of  goods  on  importation.—(1)  The
importer of any goods, other than goods intended for
transit or transhipment, shall make entry thereof by
presenting  electronically  on  the  customs  automated
system to the proper officer a bill of entry for home
consumption or warehousing in such form and manner
as may be prescribed:
Provided that the Principal Commissioner of Customs
or Commissioner of Customs may, in cases where it is
not feasible to make entry by presenting electronically
on the customs automated system, allow an entry to
be presented in any other manner:
Provided  further  that  if  the  importer  makes  and
subscribes to a declaration before the proper officer, to
the effect that he is unable for want of full information
to  furnish  all  the  particulars  of  the  goods  required
under this sub-section, the proper officer may, pending
the  production  of  such  information,  permit  him,
previous  to  the  entry  thereof  :  (a)  to  examine  the
goods in the presence of an officer of customs, or (b)
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 29 of 38
to deposit the goods in a public warehouse appointed
under Section 57 without warehousing the same.
(2) Save as otherwise permitted by the proper officer,
a bill of entry shall include all the goods mentioned in
the bill of lading or other receipt given by the carrier to
the consignor.
(3) The importer shall present the bill of entry under
sub-section (1) before the end of the day (including
holidays) preceding the day on which the aircraft or
vessel  or  vehicle  carrying  the  goods  arrives  at  a
customs station at which such goods are to be cleared
for home consumption or warehousing:
Provided that the Board may, in such cases as it may
deem fit, prescribe different time limits for presentation
of the bill of entry, which shall not be later than the end
of the day of such arrival:
Provided further that] a bill of entry may be presented
at  any  time  not  exceeding  thirty  days  prior  to  the
expected arrival of the aircraft or vessel or vehicle by
which the goods have been shipped for importation
into India:
Provided  also  that  where  the  bill  of  entry  is  not
presented within the time so specified and the proper
officer is satisfied that there was no sufficient cause for
such delay, the importer shall pay such charges for
late  presentation  of  the  bill  of  entry  as  may  be
prescribed.
(4) The importer while presenting a bill of entry shall
make and subscribe to a declaration as to the truth of
the contents of such bill of entry and shall, in support
of such declaration, produce to the proper officer the
invoice, if any, and such other documents relating to
the imported goods as may be prescribed.
(4-A) The importer who presents a bill of entry shall
ensure the following, namely—
(a) the accuracy and completeness of the information
given therein;
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 30 of 38
(b)  the  authenticity  and  validity  of  any  document
supporting it; and
(c) compliance with the restriction or prohibition, if any,
relating to the goods under this Act or under any other
law for the time being in force.
(5) If the proper officer is satisfied that the interests of
revenue are not prejudicially affected and that there
was no fraudulent intention, he may permit substitution
of a bill of entry for home consumption for a bill of
entry for warehousing or vice versa.”
However,  the  goods  were  stored  in  a  private  bonded
warehouse, in the terms of Section 68 of the Customs Act, which
reads as follows:
“68.  Clearance  of  warehoused  goods  for  home
consumption.—Any  warehoused  goods  may  be
cleared from the warehouse for home consumption, if
—
(a) a bill of entry for home consumption in respect of
such  goods  has  been  presented  in  the  prescribed
form;
(b) the import duty, interest, fine and penalties payable
in respect of such goods have been paid; and
(c) an order for clearance of such goods for home
consumption has been made by the proper officer:
Provided that the order referred to in clause (c) may
also  be  made  electronically  through  the  customs
automated  system  on  the  basis  of  risk  evaluation
through appropriate selection criteria:
Provided further that the owner of any warehoused
goods may, at any time before an order for clearance
of goods for home consumption has been made in
respect of such goods, relinquish his title to the goods
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 31 of 38
upon payment of penalties that may be payable in
respect of the goods and upon such relinquishment,
he shall not be liable to pay duty thereon:
Provided also that the owner of any such warehoused
goods shall not be allowed to relinquish his title to
such goods regarding which an offence appears to
have been committed under this Act or any other law
for the time being in force.”
The goods were not released on non-payment of customs duty
etc. and, thereupon, show cause notices dated 17th February 2000
and 10th April 2000 were issued and two adjudication orders dated
15th September 2000 and 10th October 2000 were passed.
23.
In a similar factual matrix, a three judges’ bench of this Court in
Commissioner of Customs, Calcutta and Another v.  Biecco
Lawrie Ltd.31 had examined the provisions of Section 15 of the
Customs Act, as they then existed, and have opined that clause
(b) to Section 15(1) of the Customs Act will cease to apply when
the requirements under Section 68 of  the Customs Act  stand
fulfilled  and  the  imported  goods  are  cleared  for  home
consumption. In the context of the present case, we must hold that
the debt had become ‘due’ in terms of the two adjudication orders
dated 15th September 2000 and 10th October 2000 and ‘payable’
immediately.  Thus, the customs duty became ‘due and payable’
prior to twelve months next to the ‘relevant date’; the ‘relevant
31 (2008) 3 SCC 264.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 32 of 38
date'  being  the  date  of  winding  up  of  the  Company  on  1st
December 2003. The amount ‘due and payable’ in terms of the
two  adjudication  orders  dated  15th September  2000  and  10th
October  2000  would,  therefore,  not  fall  in  the  category  of
preferential payments under clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the
Companies Act. 
24.
We have also examined Sections 61, 72 and 142 of the Customs
Act32 to consider the question of whether the Customs Act confers
and creates statutory first charge on the customs dues, and are of
the opinion that the sections do not incorporate a statutory first
charge to override the general law, as per the  dictum in  Dena
Bank (supra).  The  provisions  of  the  land  revenue  enactment
applicable in the present case have not been relied upon by the
respondents, in which event, a legal issue relating to conflict of
laws would have arisen and required an answer. The provisions in
the Customs Act do not, in any manner, negate or override the
statutory preference in terms of Section 529A of the Companies
Act, which treats the secured creditors and the workmen’s dues33
as  overriding  preferential  creditors;  and  the  government  dues
limited to debts ‘due and payable’ in the twelve months next
before the relevant date, which are to be treated as preferential
32 These provisions, though relevant, are not being reproduced for the sake of brevity.
33 As defined and payable in terms of Section 529(3)(b) of the Companies Act.
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 33 of 38
payments  under  Section  530  of  the  Companies  Act,  but  are
ranked below overriding preferential payments and have to be
paid after the payment has been made in terms of Section 529
and 529A of the Companies Act. Therefore, the prior secured
creditors are entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the
government dues payable under the Customs Act.
25.
The view and the ratio we have expressed is in consonance with
the decision of this Court in Punjab National Bank v. Union of
India and Others34. A similar view has also been expressed by a
three judges’ bench of this Court in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator
of  ABG  Shipyard v.  Central  Board  of  Indirect  Taxes  and
Customs35, with references to the provisions of the Insolvency
and  Bankruptcy  Code,  201636 and  the  Customs  Act.  In  this
context, the three judges’ bench in Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator
of ABG Shipyard (supra) has referred to Section 238 of the IBC
to observe  that  Section 238  of  the  IBC  clearly overrides  any
provision of law which is inconsistent with the IBC. This judgment
has also made reference to Section 142A of the Customs Act,
which reads thus:
“142A.  Liability  under  Act  to  be  first  charge.—
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any  Central  Act  or  State  Act,  any  amount  of  duty,

penalty,  interest  or  any  other  sum  payable  by  an
assessee or any other person under this Act, shall,
save as otherwise provided in Section 529-A of the
Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Recovery of
Debts Due to Banks and the Financial Institutions Act,
1993  (51  of  1993),  the  Securitisation  and
Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  the
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 be the first
charge on the property of the assessee or the person,
as the case may be.”
Section 142A of the Customs Act was inserted by Act 8 of 2011
with effect from 8th April 2011. It does not apply to the present
litigation. Section 142A of the Customs Act protects and ensures
that the dues under the Customs Act do not, in any way, affect the
rights of third parties under Section 529A of the Companies Act or
rights of the parties as per provisions of the Recovery of Debts
Due  to  Banks  and  the  Financial  Institutions  Act,  199337,  the
Securitisation  and  Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  the
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 200238 and the IBC. Read in
this manner, it is clear to us that the provision of Section 142A of
the Customs Act, insofar as it protects the rights of overriding
preferential creditors governed and covered by Section 529A of
the Companies Act, is clarificatory and declaratory in nature, and
does not lay down a new dictum or confer any new right as far as
the present case is concerned. However, the enactment of section
142A of the Customs Act does confer or create a first charge on

the  dues  ‘payable’  under  the  Customs  Act,  notwithstanding
provisions under any Central Act, but not in cases covered under
Section 529A of the Companies Act, RDDBFI Act, SARFAESI Act
and the IBC. Section 142A of the Customs Act, post its enactment,
would dilute the impact of Section 530 of the Companies Act,
which had restricted preferential treatment to government taxes
‘due and payable’ limited to twelve months prior to the ‘relevant
date’, without preferential right for taxes that had become ‘due and
payable’ in the earlier period.

In view of our reasoning, we must hold that the decision of the
division bench of the Calcutta High Court in Dytron (India) Ltd.
(supra) does not lay down the correct law and is, accordingly,
overruled.  The  decision  in  Dytron  (India)  Ltd. (supra)  was
referred to in  Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard
(supra), wherein this Court observed that reliance of the National
Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Dytron (India) Ltd. (supra)
was not appropriate as such interpretation has been legislatively
overruled by the inclusion of Section 142A in the Customs Act. We
wish to clarify, as held above, that the decision in Dytron (India)
Ltd. (supra) does not lay down the correct law, as even earlier, the
position in law was that the debt ‘due and payable’, when it falls
within the four corners of clause (a) to Section 530(1) of the
Civil Appeal No. 2568 of 2013
Page 36 of 38
Companies Act, would be treated as preferential payment, but it
would not override and be given preference over the payments of
overriding preferential creditors covered under Section 529A of the
Companies Act.
27.
We must also examine the decision of this Court in Imperial Chit
Funds (P) Ltd. v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam39, wherein this
Court has interpreted the legal effect of Section 178 of the Income
Tax Act, 196140, which was enacted pursuant to the report of the
Company Law Reforms Committee. On interpretation of Section
178 of the Income Tax Act, it was held that the provision is made
applicable  for  any  tax  which  is  ‘then  or  is  likely  to  become
payable’, and specifically relates to cases where the company is in
liquidation. Consequently, the amount specified and covered by
Section 178 of the Income Tax Act is protected in view of the non-
obstante clause in sub-section (6) to Section 178 and this amount
has to be set aside. In terms of Section 178 of the Income Tax Act,
the amount set aside will not form a part of the pool of dues to be
distributed  among  ordinary  or  unsecured  creditors  or,  for  that
matter, as indicated over the overriding or preferential creditors
under Sections 529A and 530 of the Companies Act.

In view of the aforesaid discussion and for the reasons stated, the
present appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment dated 26th
August 2008 in Original Side Appeal No. 1 of 2005 is set aside.
Company  Application  No.  906  of  2004  filed  by  the  Official
Liquidator in Company Petition No. 168 of 2002 will be treated as
allowed. The sale proceeds deposited in this Court and converted
into fixed deposit receipts, along with the interest accrued thereon,
will  be  paid  to  the  Official  Liquidator  to  be  distributed  in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 529A and 530 of the
Companies Act. There would be no order as to costs.
